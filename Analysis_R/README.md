# Files for posterior dose metric prediction

This folder contains R and R Markdown scripts for following analysis of MCMC simulation outputs of PBPK model:
  
  ## Convergence of markov chains of MCMC simulations of posterior parameter distributions for population mean, including:
   - Gelman & Rubin Shrink Factor scores,
   - Traceplots
   - Kernel densities 
   - Correlation matrix 
   - log-likelihood of the chains.
  
  The evaluation of convergence of the MCMC simulations were carried out using the R “coda” package v.0.19-1.
  
  ## R scripts for analysis of parameter prior and posterior distributions of: 
   - Population mean,  
   - Population variability, and
   - Strain-specific parameter posteriors
  
  ## Interpretations of model fitting, including: 
   - Global evaluation of model prediction:
      - Scatterplot of prediction vs. observation - overal
      - Violin of distribution of residual error
      - Scatterplot of prediction vs. observation - each chemical
   - PBPK model prediction of concentration-time course for:
      - Modeling Setpoint of toxicokinetics prediction
        - Combined CC 45 strains using Population-generated random strain parameter posteriori
        - Each of CC 45 strains using Strain-specific parameter posteriori
      - Test results of last iterations of each of 4 chains for Each of CC 45 strains

  ### in vivo data used for calibration and evaluation of model fitting:
   - Toxicokinetic data measured in vivo in 45 strains of CC mice obtained from our lab.
   - Limits of detection of the chemicals in tissues.
