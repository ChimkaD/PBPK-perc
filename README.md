# PBPK-perc in 3 + CC-45 strains of mice
This repository includes all files of PBPK modeling, MC/MCMC simulation and analysis of results of a manuscript titled 'Quantitative Characterization of Population-wide Tissue- and Metabolite-specific Variability in Perchloroethylene Toxicokinetics in Male Mice' submitted to Tox.Sci.

The modeling processes are complex comprised with different steps and components.

Following diagram will help to undertand a whole picture of the current Bayesian population PBPK model.
