# Files for Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)

This folder contains following files:
  - R script for:
      - eFAST test functions, 
      - Interpretitions of results and Ranking functions, and
      - Tabulating and visualization of analysis results.
  - Input files for: 
      - Parameter prior and posterior distributions, 
      - MCMC simulations to create parameter posteriors for 3 strains to be used for GSA, and 
      - Setpoint model predicitons of impact of model parameters and their interactions to the range of model outputs.
  - Output files of:
      - Posterior parameter distributions, and 
      - eFAST test results.

Global Sensitivity Analysis was conducted using eFAST test on 'pksensi' version 1.2.0 R package developed by our lab.
