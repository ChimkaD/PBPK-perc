# Files for posterior dose metric prediction

This folder contains following files:
  - PBPK model file based on MCSim under R for use of dose metric predictions.
  - R scripts for: 
      - dose metric modeling run on MCSim under R on Windows, 
      - TKVF computations and summarizing statics, and 
      - visual interpretion of the model outputs.
  - Input file for dose metric predictions.
  - Output files of dose metric predictions and TKVFs.

Dose metric predictions of PBPK model, including perc disposition and AUCs, were run on MCSim under R on Windows at 3 different oral doses of perc.

Following diagram will help you to undertand a picture of dose metric predictions of PBPK model, including perc disposition and AUCs.
